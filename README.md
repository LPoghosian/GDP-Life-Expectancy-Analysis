# GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across six countries using data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The findings will be presented through visualizations and a blog post.

## Future Work

To build upon the findings of this analysis, the following steps are suggested:

- **Incorporate More Data**: Adding additional datasets, such as healthcare statistics or demographic information, could help to refine the model.
- **Explore Advanced Techniques**: Machine learning models could be used to capture more complex relationships in the data, potentially improving the predictive power of the analysis.
